This approach is applied to a membrane reactor (MR) for the direct methane aromatization (DMA) conversion to benzene and hydrogen. The proposed method broadens the scope of the traditional path of the operability approaches for design and control, mainly oriented to obtain the achievable output set (AOS) from the available input set, and compare the computed AOS to a desired output set. In particular, an optimization algorithm based on nonlinear programming tools is formulated for the calculation of the desired input set that is feasible considering process constraints and intensification targets. Results on the application of the operability method as a tool for process intensification show reduction of the DMA-MR footprint (≈77\% reactor volume and 80\% membrane area reduction) for an equivalent level of performance, when compared to the base case.

This framework is based on nonlinear programming concepts, including bilevel optimization, and extends the application domain of classical operability approaches to process simulator runs (Aspen Plus) for obtaining the relationship between input and output spaces, in addition to first-principles models. As potential modular applications of the proposed approach, a catalytic membrane reactor (MR) for the direct methane aromatization (DMA) conversion to fuels and chemicals, and a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) system for power generation, are addressed. These applications are especially motivated by the advent of the shale gas revolution that allowed the recent discovery of stranded shale/natural gas deposits at different shale formations in the U.S. The utilization of such deposits could be capitalized by employing modular technologies for the production of power, value-added chemicals and fuels at the site. However, the design and intensification of modular energy systems is a challenging task as these processes are represented by complex and nonlinear models. The obtained results indicate that the proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the realization of the concept of modular manufacturing with reduced footprint and maximized efficiency, resulting in future cost savings. In particular for the NGCC process, the results provide the gas and steam turbine cycle conditions that could enable modular plants that are about three orders of magnitude smaller in terms of power generation than typical operating processes."

Noteworthy that it is possible to get surrogate models accurate enough with up to seven degrees of freedom."

This framework aims to quantify the inherent operability of a process without having to specify the control structure. It enables the identification of inoperable processes, regardless of the feedback controller selected, necessitating process rather than controller changes. Evaluation of steady-state operability is a necessary first step which should subsequently be complemented by the examination of the dynamic operability. The defined concepts are based on some key operating spaces. These spaces define the available ranges of input variables, the desired ranges of output variables, and the expected ranges of disturbance variables of the process. The calculation of the operability index is demonstrated for linear and the more general case of nonlinear models. This is achieved by mapping the defined input and output spaces onto each other using the nonlinear steady-state model of the process. Dynamic operability is examined by solving an optimal control problem to find the minimum time within which the process can respond to a disturbance or move to a new operating point with the available ranges of inputs."

The special application considered is the optimization of modular process simulators in which the derivatives are not available and some unit operations introduce noise preventing the calculation of accurate derivatives. The black box modules are substituted by metamodels based on a kriging interpolation that assumes that the errors are not independent but a function of the independent variables. A Kriging metamodel uses non-Euclidean measure of distance to avoid sensitivity to the units of measure. It includes adjustable parameters that weigh the importance of each variable for obtaining a good model representation, and it allows calculating errors that can be used to establish stopping criteria and provide a solid base to deal with “possible infeasibility” due to inaccuracies in the metamodel representation of objective function and constraints. The algorithm continues with a refining stage and successive bound contraction in the domain of independent variables with or without kriging recalibration until an acceptable accuracy in the metamodel is obtained. The procedure is illustrated with several examples. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2008},

This measure ascertains the inherent controllability of the process, as it is calculated in the absence of any regulatory control structure. For the process examples utilized in this paper, it is also independent of the inventory control structure that might be assumed present in order to keep the inventory levels constant. This measure evaluates the ability of a design to reach all points of the desired output space and to reject the expected disturbances utilizing input action not exceeding the available input space. Besides being applicable to a SISO (Single Input, Signal Output) case, its multivariable character is shown to be more appropriate than existing measures such as RGA (Relative Gain Array), minimum singular value, and condition number."

abstract = {Process operability emerged in the last decades as a powerful tool for the design and control of chemical processes. Recent efforts in operability have been focused on the calculation of the desired input set for process design and intensification of natural gas utilization applications described by nonlinear models. However, there is still a gap in terms of problem dimensionality that nonlinear operability methods can handle. To fill this gap, in this article, the incorporation of bilevel and parallel programing approaches into classical process operability concepts is discussed. Results on the implementation of the proposed method show a reduction in computational time up to two orders of magnitude, when compared to the original results without parallelization. These results could be extrapolated for use in a supercomputer as presented in the computational time analysis performed. In terms of intensification, the proposed approach can produce a natural gas combined cycle plant modular design with a dramatic reduction in size, from the original 400 to 0.11 MW, while still keeping the high net plant efficiency. This approach thus provides a computationally efficient framework for process intensification of high-dimensional nonlinear energy systems toward modularity. The proposed approach also enables the verification of a modular design and conditions that can be obtained according to economic and physical constraints associated with a specific natural gas well production. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 3042–3054, 2018},

Specifically, two issues are addressed: feasibility evaluation of black-box processes using Kriging and development of an adaptive sampling strategy in order to minimize sampling cost, while maintaining feasibility space accuracy. Kriging is chosen as the interpolating technique for constructing a response surface of the feasibility function as a function of the uncertain parameters when a set of input–output data are available. The adaptive sampling strategy identifies critical regions and directs the search towards feasibility boundaries or where the Kriging prediction uncertainty is high. The average Kriging prediction error and cross-validation methods are used to validate the robustness of the produced model of the initial experimental design which is found to highly affect the final predicted feasible region.}

To properly balance the computational cost of building the model against the probability of convergence to global optimum, a hybrid methodology is proposed. A kriging approach is first applied to provide information about the global behavior of the system considered, whereas a response surface method is considered close to the optimum to refine the set of candidate local optima and find the global optimum. The kriging predictor is a global model employing normally distributed basis functions, so both an expected sampling value and its variance are obtained for each test point. The presented work extends the capabilities of existing response surface techniques to address the refinement of optima located in regions described by convex asymmetrical feasible regions containing arbitrary linear and nonlinear constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to previously developed stand-alone response surface techniques and its effectiveness is evaluated in terms of the number of function calls required, number of times the global optimum is found, and computational time. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007},

This may also be true if the outputs are equal in number to the inputs and disturbances of high magnitude exist. A linear programming framework is postulated to calculate the tightest achievable operating ranges of the outputs, given the ranges of the inputs and the expected disturbances, for any linear input–output control system at the steady-state. This approach removes the computational constraints on the size of the problem that a previous communication of the authors [1] could address. The hyper-volume obtained for the tightest achievable outputs’ region of a high-dimensional industrial process is calculated to be four orders of magnitude smaller than the one initially assumed, enabling much tighter control.}

abstract = {A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) operability approach is developed for the design of high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. For the approach formulation, classical operability concepts are extended to attain process intensification towards system modularity. Motivated by natural gas utilization processes, a catalytic membrane reactor for the direct methane aromatization (DMA-MR) conversion to hydrogen and benzene is chosen as case study. The DMA-MR is described by a system whose design is challenged by complexity, including nonlinearities and a highly-constrained environment. A DMA-MR subsystem is addressed, for which 80% reduction in membrane area and 78% reduction in reactor volume is obtained when compared to a base case with equivalent performance. The proposed approach presents a computational time reduction greater than 3 orders of magnitude compared with previously introduced nonlinear programming-based operability approaches. These results indicate that the proposed approach is computationally efficient and thus can be extended to address higher dimensional cases.}

abstract = {Abstract This article presents a comparative review on the operability and flexibility concepts and their application to process design and control. First, the operability and flexibility methodologies are summarized. Then the application of the operability framework to steady-state and dynamic systems is illustrated through the examination of several example categories such as linear and nonlinear, square and non-square systems. The flexibility approach based on the active set strategy is used to study the same examples from the flexibility point of view. The discussed results show that the operability and flexibility approaches examine a process from different perspectives and provide valuable complementary information. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2010},

abstract = {Abstract The objective in this work is to propose a novel approach for solving inverse problems from the output space to the input space using automatic differentiation coupled with the implicit function theorem and a path integration scheme. A common way of solving inverse problems in process systems engineering (PSE) and in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in general is using nonlinear programming (NLP) tools, which may become computationally expensive when both the underlying process model complexity and dimensionality increase. The proposed approach takes advantage of recent advances in robust automatic differentiation packages to calculate the input space region by integration of governing differential equations of a given process. Such calculations are performed based on an initial starting point from the output space and are capable of maintaining accuracy and reducing computational time when compared to using NLP-based approaches to obtain the inverse mapping. Two nonlinear case studies, namely a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a membrane reactor for conversion of natural gas to value-added chemicals are addressed using the proposed approach and compared against: (i) extensive (brute-force) search for forward mapping and (ii) using NLP solvers for obtaining the inverse mapping. The obtained results show that the novel approach is in agreement with the typical approaches, while computational time and complexity are considerably reduced, indicating that a new direction for solving inverse problems is developed in this work.}
